## Overview
This project addresses toxicity detection in Hinglish social media text, a mix of Hindi and English written in Roman script. Existing toxicity detection systems trained on monolingual English struggle with Hinglish due to transliteration variations, spelling inconsistencies, and informal grammar.  
We develop a pipeline combining phonetic normalization, classical machine learning models, and transformer-based approaches.

## Methods
- Phonetic Normalization to reduce noise in code-mixed text  
- Classical ML models: TF-IDF with Logistic Regression and SVM  
- Transformer model: MuRIL  
- Model interpretability with LIME and SHAP

## Dataset
PRISM Hinglish Hate Speech Dataset
